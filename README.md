# LAVA — Linguistic Attack Vector Analytics

**Offline • Single-file • Analysis**

Developed by **BGGG (Background Gremlin Group)**  
*Unique Tools for Unique Individuals*

LAVA is a fully client-side stylometric analysis tool that runs entirely in your browser. No data leaves your machine — perfect for dissecting linguistic patterns in any text.

## Primary Purpose: Analyzing Your Own Writing
LAVA excels at revealing your personal stylistic fingerprints — overused words, frequency habits, and repeatable patterns. Use it to refine your voice, increase variety, or deliberately obscure your signature.

## Full Capability: Analyzing Any Text
Paste or upload writing from anywhere. LAVA works equally well on your own drafts or any other text you have access to.

## Features

- **Neon token highlighting** – Every word colored by frequency rank:
  - Red → most dominant
  - Yellow → second-tier repeats
  - Green → rare / low-frequency
  - Cyan → neutral / mid-range
- **Interactive controls** – Click word chips to exclude, Shift+click to pin
- **Top 30 bar chart** of highest-frequency terms
- **Detailed frequency table** with count and percentage
